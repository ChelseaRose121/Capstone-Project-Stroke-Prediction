# Stroke Risk Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop machine learning models that accurately predict individuals at high risk of stroke based on biometric and lifestyle factors. The goal is to support early intervention and improve preventive healthcare outcomes.

## Data Preprocessing
- Imputed missing BMI and smoking status values
- One-hot encoded categorical variables
- Standardized continuous variables (age, glucose, BMI)
- 80/20 train-test split

## Models Used
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors

## Evaluation
- Accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score
- Confusion matrix visuals

## Results
- Random Forest had the highest accuracy: **0.9967**
- Top predictors: age, average glucose, BMI

## Future Work
- Train on larger, more diverse datasets
- Add wearable device data
- Collaborate with medical professionals for deployment

## Conclusion
Random Forest showed high potential for real-world use in early stroke detection.
